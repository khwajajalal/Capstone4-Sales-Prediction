# Capstone4-Sales-Prediction

The data set is extracted from Kaggle website for 1C company. This data set is the sales details for January 2013 to October 2015 for 60 shops.
My objective is to clean, explore, and explain the data. Besides, I run a time seires model on this data set.
I used Python for exploring and cleaning the data as well as for some visualization, and I used Tableau mainly for visualization. 
I run the time  series model in pythong using Prophet package. I used Prophet time series modeling approach to forecast next three months sales based of the historical data.
